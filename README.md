# Roaring.io API-wrapper

This is a (very) simple wrapper for the roaring.io API.

The wrapper is designed to have really no contraints in place, just create a new object with your API-keys and then select which endpoint you want to call. The source also includes a service provider for Laravel (Laravel 5.5 and up).

Built using the [httpful](https://github.com/nategood/httpful)-library.
